            <h2>Digitization of health and welfare services</h2>
        
        <p> <!--2.3 Digitization of health and welfare services-->
            The digitization of health- and welfare services can be a means of spending scarce resources more efficiently.
            Digital services can also provide flexibility so that clients and patients will be better able to integrate 
            treatment and welfare programs in their daily life. At the same time, there are challenges connected to the 
            digitization in the health- and welfare sector.In the first video, Anders Underthun, senior researcher at 
            the Work Research Institute at OsloMet, will present a case of how home care services have been digitized 
            in a Norwegian municipality. He will show how the introduction of digital work-lists makes it easier for 
            the nurses to meet the varying needs of their patients, and also point out some challenges that arise when
            face-to-face communication with colleagues is replaced with digital communication. Digitization does not
            necessarily imply turning an existing paper-based system into a digital replica. The following video will 
            present how NAV, the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration, approaches digitization as an opportunity
            for transformation.

        <h2>Innovation in the digital city</h2>
        
        <p> <!--2.4 Innovation in the digital city-->
            Cities are arenas of formal and casual interaction between different professions, different companies
            and organizations, and different groups of people. This can provide a fertile ground for innovation. What is innovation?
            Tor Paaske Utheim at Department of Research and Development, OsloMet, will give an answer to this in the first video.
            Tor Paaske Utheim defines innovation as something that is new, useful and implemented. Think about the rapid digitalization
            in response to the corona crisis. Do you have an example of something that can be categorized as an innovation in this context?
            Why can this be labeled an innovation?
            <br>
            Good ideas, access to collaboration partners, and access to financing are important elements in an innovation process.
            Another crucial element is insight about the potential users and the use context. In the following video, Max Tangen,
            CEO in 7Sense Products, will explain how his company has used the method 'design driven innovation' to develop relevant
            and attractive products for their customers.Think about your field of study, future profession, or another field that
            you are interested in. How could design driven innovation be used to generate better products or services in this context?
            <br>
            Every now and then a new technology brings about profound societal changes. Is the electric scooter a radical innovation
            with the capacity to change urban living significantly? Hanne Cecilie Geirbo, Associate Professor at Department of
            Computer Science, OsloMet, will speculate on this by looking at the electric scooters through the lenses of transport,
            data and machine learning, universal design, and sustainability.
